/**
 * The contract between this package and stonedog-style (NEH-263).
 *
 * stonedog-style knows no colours. Every colour is a Panda token whose value is
 * a bare CSS custom property, and `requiredCssCustomProperties()` is the list of
 * properties a host must define for the components to render at all.
 *
 * This package's job is to produce them. Nothing checked that it did.
 *
 * **The failure mode is why this matters more than a normal missing test.** A
 * token whose property is undefined renders as *nothing* — no build error, no
 * console warning, no type error. An invisible element still has a bounding
 * box, so even a layout assertion passes. Three bugs of exactly this shape were
 * found during the original extraction (NEH-165/166/171).
 *
 * The list is imported from the sibling checkout rather than copied here. Two
 * copies of a contract drift, and this test exists precisely because that drift
 * is undetectable at runtime.
