/**
 * The public theme catalogue: reading and writing `<slug>.theme.json` files.
 *
 * ## Why this is a separate entry point
 *
 * This module touches `node:fs` and `node:path`. The main entry deliberately
 * does not — RozCards imports `parseJsonTheme` from a Next.js server component
 * that sits in the same module graph as client code, and pulling `fs` into that
 * graph is a bundler error rather than a runtime one. So the catalogue ships as
 * `@stonedogcode/theme/catalogue` and the resolver half stays isomorphic.
 *
 * ## Why every function takes a directory
 *
 * There is no "find my own themes directory" helper here, on purpose. This
 * package is built by tsup into **both** CJS and ESM, and the two disagree
 * about how a module locates itself — `__dirname` does not exist in ESM,
 * `import.meta.url` is a syntax error in CJS. A self-locating helper works in
 * whichever format the author tested and fails in the other, at the consumer's
 * build, with an error about neither themes nor formats.
 *
 * Taking a path is also what makes this usable for the thing it is actually
 * for. Each product's own copy of its theme is the **source of truth**, and the
 * catalogue is a published mirror — so the same list/load/write functions have
 * to work against a product's own directory and against the package's, without
 * knowing which is which.
 *
 * Consumers resolve the package's directory themselves:
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { dirname, join } from "node:path";
 * import { createRequire } from "node:module";
 *
 * const require = createRequire(import.meta.url);
 * const catalogueDir = join(dirname(require.resolve("@stonedogcode/theme/package.json")), "themes");
 * ```
